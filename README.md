# Rain Prediction Australia

This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia using machine learning models (ANN architectures).

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for model development and training (V1, V2, V3).
- **docs/**: Final project report and appendix with model outputs.
- **presentation/**: Project presentation slides.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Models

- **Version 1**: Baseline ANN from Kaggle notebook.
- **Version 2**: Weighted loss optimization to improve rain day detection.
- **Version 3**: ANN with residual connections and CLR for learning rate.

**Note:** In the future, an additional RNN (LSTM-based) model may be added for sequential prediction.
